# the currencies tab can be edited to your liking, but a few default values are set.
# ALL CURRENCY NAMES MUST BE LOWER CASE OR THE PLUGIN WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THEM
# After you are done editing your config, please set hasBeenEdited to true to get rid of the message on server start.
# The values tab is for an up and coming update to add a basic selling system to the plugin, but anything more complicated will require another plugin.
